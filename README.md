The objective of this project is to quantify the biomarker(s) in the choroidal vasculature that could potentially enable the early detection of vision threatening diseases including AMD, CSCR and pachychoroid.
The one such biomarker is identified as the estimation of cross-section (CS) diameter of the choroidal blood vessels.

Implementation details:
The code was primarly written using Matlab and some portion of them using python

Here: CHS_OD_Mask_500_250_1024.m is the main script.
Some of the key steps involved are:
  1) Estimation of choroid inner and outer boundaries
  2) Estimation of choroid vessel segmentation
  3) Estimation of CS diameter
