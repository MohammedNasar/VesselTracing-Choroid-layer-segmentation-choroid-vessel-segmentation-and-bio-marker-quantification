The objective of this project is to quantify the biomarker(s) in choroidal vasculature that can potentially enable the early detection of vision threatening diseases including AMD, CSCR and pachychoroid.
The one such biomarker is identified as the estimation of cross-section (CS) diameter of choroidal vessels.

Program:
Here: CHS_OD_Mask_500_250_1024.m is the main script.
Some of the key steps involved are:
  1) Estimation of choroid inner and outer boundaries
  2) Estimation of choroid vessel segmentation
  3) Estimation of CS diameter
