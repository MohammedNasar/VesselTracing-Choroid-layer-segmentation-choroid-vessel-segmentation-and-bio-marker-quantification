The project aims to identify and quantify biomarkers within the choroidal vasculature that could potentially facilitate early detection of vision-threatening diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), and pachychoroid. One key biomarker identified is the cross-sectional (CS) diameter of choroidal blood vessels.

The implementation primarily utilizes MATLAB, with some portions written in Python. The main script, "CHS_OD_Mask_500_250_1024.m", encompasses several crucial steps:

1. Delineation of choroid boundaries:
   - Identifying the inner boundary
   - Locating the outer boundary

2. Choroidal vessel segmentation:
   - Isolating and defining the blood vessels within the choroid

3. CS diameter estimation:
   - Calculating the cross-sectional diameter of the identified choroidal blood vessels

This approach aims to provide quantitative measurements of choroidal vascular structures, potentially offering early indicators of ocular pathologies affecting the choroid.
